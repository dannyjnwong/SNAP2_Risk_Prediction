## How to use this repository
All the analyses within the above paper can be reproduced using the [`SNAP2_Clinician_Predictions_Analysis.R`](https://github.com/dannyjnwong/SNAP2_Risk_Prediction/blob/main/SNAP2_Clinician_Predictions_Analysis.R) script file contained in this repository. While the manuscript was originally written as an `.Rmd` file as I have previously done in the past, there was substantial editing done in Microsoft Word due to the collaboration with multiple authors, such that the `.Rmd` file output differed substantially from the final manuscript versions accepted by the journal for publication. I have therefore elected not to include the `.Rmd` file in this instance, and instead include just the `R` script for the analyses themselves to be reproduced.
